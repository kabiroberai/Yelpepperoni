# Yelpepperoni

This is the repo corresponding to my DeepDishSwift talk **Is your app secure? Revalations a Jedi wouldn't tell you.**

The "main" branch of the repo corresponds to the version of the app with several vulnerabilities. See the `start/*` and `finish/*` branches for the various demo stages that fix these issues.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The demo code here should not be considered a reference implementation; I've simplified a lot of things for brevity. Please read the respective documentation for the right way to go about these things.
