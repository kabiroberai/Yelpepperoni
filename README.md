# Yelpepperoni

This is the repo corresponding to my DeepDishSwift talk **Is your app secure? Revalations a Jedi wouldn't tell you.**

The "main" branch of the repo corresponds to the version of the app with several vulnerabilities. See the `start/*` and `finish/*` branches for the various demo stages that fix these issues.
